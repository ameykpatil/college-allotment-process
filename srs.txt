CAP stands for College Allotment Process.

EXISTING SYSTEM:
The current admission procedure for autonomous engineering colleges works as follows:
1.Student fills an application form
2.Student submits it at a submission centre.
3.Every student is given a rank based on his/her marks.
4.Then a counselling round is held in which the student has to visit a fixed centre.
5.Here,in the order of ranks, the students are asked to choose from the vacant seats.
6.Student has to confirm his/her admission then and there.

Drawbacks:
1.Student has to go to one of the centres and purchase an application form.
2.The student loses his chance if he fails to reach the counselling centre at the given time.
3.The student has to take admission then and there. Even a slight delay is also not allowed.
4.It may happen that the fixed location of the centre may not be convenient for all students. 
5.Since the procedure is manual it is prone to errors.
6.Time and money is wasted in transportation. 
7.As there is only one counselling centre,it will be crowded.
8.Allocation of manpower is another problem.	


PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The CAP (College Admission Process) works as follows:
1.Student fills an application form and submits it online .
2.
